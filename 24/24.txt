Retrieve characters from the keyboard (without Polish tails and without capital letters) and enter them into the list according to the following rule: vowels always at the beginning of the list, other characters at the end of the list. If the * or # symbol appears, do not insert them; instead, remove the first character (for *) or the last character (for #), if there is anything to remove, from the list. End the retrieval and insertion loop when the ! (exclamation mark) character is entered.
