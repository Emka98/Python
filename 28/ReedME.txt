Download one character in a loop. Ignore characters that are not digit characters (0 - 9). Break the loop when you have collected five digits, e.g. '1', '4', '3', '5', '0'. Create an integer variable that will be the number formed from these digits. For the given example, this would be the integer: 14,350. Also create the number in reverse order of digits. In both cases, if the number starts with the digit 0, it should be ignored. For example, 05341 becomes 5341. Display the sum of both resulting numbers.
