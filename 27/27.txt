Create three lists (list) with the following contents (file 27_lists.txt):v1=[1,3,5,7,9]v2=[1,4,7,11,15]v3=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,20]Treat them as sets where each element can appear only once. For example, after adding the number 5 to set v1, the set would not change because 5 is already there. For the given lists/sets display:a) the intersection of the sets: v1 and v2 [2],b) the difference of set v3 and the union of sets v1+v2 := v3-(v1+v2) [3],c) the union of all sets v1, v2, and v3 := v1+v2+v3 [2].
