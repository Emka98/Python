Retrieve integers from the keyboard in a loop, and insert them into list V. The detailed procedure inside the loop consists of the following steps:1. Retrieve a number and add it to the end of the list.2. Retrieve a number and add it to the end of the list (yes, the same command within the loop step) [1].3. If the product of the two last numbers in the list does not exceed 1000, also add that product to list V and return to step 1. If that product exceeds 1000, terminate the loop [1].Display the list after exiting the loop.
